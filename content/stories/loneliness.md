"They control the world."

I look at Jim to see if he has something to say. He never does. The silent type, Jim.

"I don't understand why you aren't more worried. I'm telling you, they control everything that happens".

I thought I saw a hint of a smirk on Jim's face. I feel blood rushing to my head as I struggle to keep my anger in check. I hate it when nobody listens to me. Of late, nobody seems to listen to me anymore. Of late, I've been more angry than usual.

"Global warming, genetic engineering, antibiotic resistance, global cartels, wealth inequality - they're all carefully choreographed by a shadowy cabal, Jim." I said. "I feel I'm just wasting my breath talking to you. All you do is sit there and smirk at me."

Jim was my best friend, my only friend. His silence hurts.

I hear a knock on the door. Steve walks in.

"Good morning Steve." I say.

Steve looks at me warily, and then at Jim.

"I don't want any trouble today." says Steve as he holds out a paper cup with two blue pills in them. I take the cup, swallow the pills and hand it back.

I feel the pills taking effect immediately.

I look back at the mirror and all I see is myself - unshaven, unkempt, in a white, padded room. Steve standing by the door.

Loneliness overwhelms me.

"Take care, Jim." says Steve as walks out and bolts the door behind him.
