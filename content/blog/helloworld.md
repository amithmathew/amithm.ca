Hello World! 

I've been meaning to get back to writing again, without much luck. I wanted a static site that I could host on S3, and as far as Shiny and Distracting Tools(tm) go, Pelican and Hugo are up there on top. So after playing around with both for a while, I decided to roll out my own, obviously.

So here we are.

[PyJello](https://github.com/amithmathew/pyjello) supports both blog-style lists and pinned list formats. 
You can build your templates using Jinja2 and write your content with Markdown.
Did I say its extremely customizable? That's because there's not much to it, so its easy to grok.

PyJello is in extreme alpha at the moment - that means that the code quality sucks, and it might set your computer on fire. You have been warned.
